# Record Resolver

Scripts used to resolve records between multiple 17th century Irish records.

The structure of the files tends to vary, so the intended use of this repo is to import either the Landowner or the Property class and use them to compute the similarity between corresponding fields.

Gazetteers which help to generate name permutations or resolve spelling anomalies for landowners are in the `config.py` file.
